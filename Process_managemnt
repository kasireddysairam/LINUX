1.CPU and OS
CPU = Worker who does the actual work
OS (Operating System) = Manager who tells the worker what to do

The CPU performs the task.
The OS manages and controls the work.
==========================================
2.Process
A process is a running instance of any program.
Examples: python, shell, etc.
Commands:
ps aux | nl
→ Gives the list of processes with line numbers.
ps aux | wc -l
→ Gives only the total number of processes.

Difference Between ps aux and ps -ef
ps aux
→ Shows CPU and memory utilization of processes.
ps -ef
→ Does NOT show CPU and memory usage.
→ Shows full-format listing (UID, PID, PPID, start time, etc.).

Process Priority
We can set priority for a process using:
renice -n 10 -p <PID>
-n 10 → Sets the nice value (priority)
-p → Process ID
=====================================================
3.Services
Services are background-running processes.
Services start automatically during server boot.

To list services:
systemctl list-units --type=service
Service vs Process

Service → Managed by systemd
Process → Managed by the Kernel



service are background running  process
**services start at booting of our  server

To list services
systemctl list-units --type=service

Service → managed by systemd
Process → managed by kernel

All external commands create new processes. location(/bin/ls)
Executed by
Kernel loads program

Built-in commands run inside the shell process.location(Inside bash)
Executed by
Shell runs directly
