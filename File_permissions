1.Introduction to File Permissions
Linux file permissions determine who can read, write, or execute files and directories. Each file and directory has three levels of permission:
Owner (User): The creator of the file.
Group: Users belonging to the assigned group.
Others: All other users on the system.

2.Permissions are represented as:
Read (r or 4) – View file contents.
Write (w or 2) – Modify file contents.
Execute (x or 1) – Run scripts or programs.


3.Changing Permissions with chmod
Using Symbolic Mode:
Modify permissions using symbols:
Add (+), remove (-), or set (=) permissions.

chmod is used for changing file permission  in linux 
Examples:
chmod u+x filename  # Add execute for user
chmod g-w filename  # Remove write for group
chmod o=r filename  # Set read-only for others
chmod u=rwx,g=rx,o= filename  # Set full access for user, read/execute for group, and no access for others

Note: chmod is used for files and folders to change permissions

4.Changing Ownership with chown
Modify file owner and group:
chown newuser filename  # Change owner
chown newuser:newgroup filename  # Change owner and group
chown :newgroup filename  # Change only group
