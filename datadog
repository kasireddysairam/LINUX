Aggregation means:
How Datadog combines multiple data points into one value.
That combining process = Aggregation
There are 2 levels of aggregation:
1️⃣ Time Aggregation (Over Time)
Example:
CPU values in 1 minute:
10%
20%
30%
40%
avg()===> 10+20+30+40/4==25%
max()===>  40%
min()===> 10%
count() ==>Real Use Case:
How many times error happened.-->count:aws.lambda.errors{env:prod}


2️⃣ Space Aggregation (Across Hosts / Resources)
Example:
You have 3 EC2 instances:
Instance A → 40%
Instance B → 60%
Instance C → 20%

=============================
avg() vs sum()
avg()
Calculates average value	
Used for utilization
avg() is used for percentage  basis like cpu ,meory,disk

sum()
Adds all values together
Used for counts,total volume
==>Count (errors, failures, requests)
