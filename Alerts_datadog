alerts=> we need to take action now

==>Understanding Aggregation in Alerts
Alerts use TWO aggregations:
1️⃣ Time aggregation
2️⃣ Space aggregation


1.TIME Aggregation
Example:
avg(last_5m):metric
Means:
Take last 5 minutes of data and average it.

2.SPACE Aggregation
Example:
avg:system.cpu.user{env:prod}
Means:
Average across all hosts.
example:
If:
Host1 = 95%
Host2 = 20%
Host3 = 25%

avg = 46%
No alert.

But if you use:
max:system.cpu.user{env:prod}
max = 95%
======================================================

Important Alert Decision
Ask:
Do I care about cluster health or single host?
Cluster health → avg
Single host safety → max by host

What is Aggregation?
When you create an alert in Datadog, system asks:
How do you want to combine data?
There are two directions:
1️⃣ Across hosts (space aggregation)
2️⃣ Across time (time aggregation)
================================================

First Understand: What is Aggregation?

Aggregation = “How Datadog combines data”

There are 2 types in alerts:

Type	                     Meaning	                                       Think Like
Time Aggregation	         How values are combined over time	Over         minutes
Space Aggregation	         How values are combined across machines	       Across instances
